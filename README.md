## *Description:*
This web page will output the encoded version of a given block of text. This program will use method called *square code*.   
To use square code the spaces and punctuation are removed from the English text and the characters are written into a square (or rectangle) and the entire message is downcased. The size of the square (number of columns) is decided by the length of the message. If the message is a length that creates a perfect square (e.g. 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, etc), that number of columns used. If the message doesn't fit neatly into a square, the number of columns is corresponded to the smallest square that is larger than the number of characters in the message.
